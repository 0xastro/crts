# Scenarios
Scenarios are defined by configuration files in the <CRTS>/scenarios/ directory. Each scenario must specify the number of nodes and run time of the scenario. The parameters of each node must then be defined. Look at the example.cfg scenario to get an idea of the parameters available to you for each scenario. In general you will need to set parameters related to the cognitive radio networking, the cognitive engine, log files, and initial physical layer settings. In some cases, a user may not care about a particular parameter e.g. the forward error correction scheme. In this case it can be ommitted and the default value will be used.
