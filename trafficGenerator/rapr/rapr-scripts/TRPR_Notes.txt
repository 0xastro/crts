TRPR can be used to plot mgen logs resulting from RAPR experiments.

Something like:

trpr mgen send recv multiplot flow X,X,10.0.0.1/8001 flow X,X,10.0.0.2/8000 input mgen-server-http.log output server.plot

Can be used....

this would take all flows in and out of a server at 10.0.0.2/8000 and plot the incoming flows from a client at 10.0.0.2/8001 and outgoing flows to that same clients on separate plot lines making transactions easier to visualize.

To plot all traffic received from specific clients (replace the src node ip
address as appropriate):

/trpr/trpr recv flow X,::ffff:10.0.0.1/X,X/X,X flow
X,::ffff:10.0.0.2/X,X/X,X flow X,::ffff:10.0.0.3/X,X/X,X mgen input
group-interaction-example/mgen-chat-server.log output server.plot

To plot all traffic to the multicast address from specific clients
(replace the src node ip address as appropriate):

 ~/trpr/trpr recv flow X,::ffff:10.0.0.1/X,239.1.1.1/X,X flow
 X,::ffff:10.0.0.2/X,239.1.1.1/X,X flow
 X,::ffff:10.0.0.3/X,239.1.1.1/X,X mgen input
 group-interaction-example/mgen-chat-server.log output test-mc.plot


Not great but something.  A RAPR parser that plots events (SUCCESS, FAILURE) would perhaps be better and could likely easily be written in python,etc.
